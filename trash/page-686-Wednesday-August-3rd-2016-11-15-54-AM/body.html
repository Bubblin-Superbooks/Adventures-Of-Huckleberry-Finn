<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;This is a surprise to me which I wasn&apos;t looking for; and I&apos;ll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain&apos;t very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he&apos;s broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake. </p><p> I am Peter Wilks&apos; brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can&apos;t hear nor speak&#x2014;and can&apos;t even make signs to amount to much, now&apos;t he&apos;s only got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. </p><p>So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out:</p></div> </div>
