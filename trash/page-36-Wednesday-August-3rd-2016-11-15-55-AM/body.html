<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn&apos;t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. </p><p> Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that&apos;s on its mind and can&apos;t make itself understood, and so can&apos;t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. </p></div> </div>
