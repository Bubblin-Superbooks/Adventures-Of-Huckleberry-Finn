<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn&apos;t a turned in anyway if I&apos;d had a bed, because a body don&apos;t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there&apos;d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you&apos;d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!&#x2014;bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum&#x2014;and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit&#x2014;and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager. </p></div> </div>
