<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn&apos;t nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them. I didn&apos;t mind the lickings, because they didn&apos;t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot. </p><p> But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim&apos;s was when they&apos;d all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn&apos;t like the spiders, and the spiders didn&apos;t like Jim; and so they&apos;d lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. </p></div> </div>
