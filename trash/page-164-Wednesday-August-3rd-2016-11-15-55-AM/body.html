<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I didn&apos;t sleep much. I couldn&apos;t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn&apos;t do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can&apos;t live this way; I&apos;m a-going to find out who it is that&apos;s here on the island with me; I&apos;ll find it out or bust. </p><p> So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. </p></div> </div>
