If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn&apos;t come, for we hadn&apos;t ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. </p><p>If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn&apos;t no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.</p></div> </div>
