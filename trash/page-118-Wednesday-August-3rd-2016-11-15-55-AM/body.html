<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin&apos; for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! That ain&apos;t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o&apos; my property. </p><p> Here&apos;s what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up&apos;ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain&apos;t fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can&apos;t get his rights in a govment like this. </p></div> </div>
