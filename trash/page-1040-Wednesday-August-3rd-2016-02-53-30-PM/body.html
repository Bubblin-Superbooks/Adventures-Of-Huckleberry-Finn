<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;People to help him, Brother Marples! Well, I reckon you&apos;d think so if you&apos;d a been in this house for a while back. Why, they&apos;ve stole everything they could lay their hands on&#x2014;and we a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o&apos; the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther&apos; ain&apos;t no telling how many times they didn&apos;t steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day and night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools us but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time! I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever heard of. </p></div> </div>
