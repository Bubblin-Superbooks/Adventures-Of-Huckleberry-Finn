<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When I got to camp I warn&apos;t feeling very brash, there warn&apos;t much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain&apos;t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year&apos;s camp, and then clumb a tree.</p><p> I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn&apos;t see nothing, I didn&apos;t hear nothing&#x2014;I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn&apos;t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. </p></div> </div>
