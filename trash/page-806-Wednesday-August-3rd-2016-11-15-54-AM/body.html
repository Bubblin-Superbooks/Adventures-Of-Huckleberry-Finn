<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jim&apos;s the prisoner. All right&#x2014;I&apos;m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn&apos;t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we&apos;ll take the one we like the best.&quot; </p><p>What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer&apos;s head I wouldn&apos;t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:</p><p>&quot;Ready?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I says.</p></div> </div>
