Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck&apos;s gun go off at my ear, and Harney&apos;s hat tumbled off from his head. </p><p> He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn&apos;t wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn&apos;t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come&#x2014;to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn&apos;t see. </p></div> </div>
