He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn&apos;t sell them, they&apos;d get an Ab&apos;litionist to go and steal them. </p></div> </div>
