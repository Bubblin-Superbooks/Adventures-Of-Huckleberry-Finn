Tom says it wasn&apos;t enough; but I said nobody wouldn&apos;t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they&apos;d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole&#x2014;then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. </p><p>&quot;Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Take them in through the hole,&quot; I says, &quot;when we get it done.&quot;</p></div> </div>
