<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson&apos;s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn&apos;t any signs of the bar at the head&#x2014;it was all under water now.</p><p> It didn&apos;t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside. </p></div> </div>
