<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn&apos;t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. </p><p> I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it&apos;s a still night. </p></div> </div>
