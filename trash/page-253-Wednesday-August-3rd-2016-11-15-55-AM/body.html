Not for pie, he wouldn&apos;t. He&apos;d call it an adventure&#x2014;that&apos;s what he&apos;d call it; and he&apos;d land on that wreck if it was his last act. </p><p>Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn&apos;t talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.</p></div> </div>
