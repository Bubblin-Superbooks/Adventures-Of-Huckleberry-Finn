You&apos;ve acted this way before. You always want more&apos;n your share of the truck, and you&apos;ve always got it, too, because you&apos;ve swore &apos;t if you didn&apos;t you&apos;d tell. But this time you&apos;ve said it jest one time too many. You&apos;re the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.&quot;</p></div> </div>
