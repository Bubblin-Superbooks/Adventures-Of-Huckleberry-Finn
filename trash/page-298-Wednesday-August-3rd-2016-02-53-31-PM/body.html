It&apos;s the beatenest thing I ever struck. And <i>then</i> what did you all do?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Well, we hollered and took on, but it&apos;s so wide there we couldn&apos;t make nobody hear.

I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn&apos;t strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he&apos;d fix the thing. </p></div> </div>
