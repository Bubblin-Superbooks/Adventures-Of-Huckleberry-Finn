They&apos;ll soon get tired of that, and won&apos;t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson&apos;s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. </p><p> I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn&apos;t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. </p></div> </div>
