We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.</p><p> Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn&apos;t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn&apos;t anything but little saplings to tie to. </p></div> </div>
