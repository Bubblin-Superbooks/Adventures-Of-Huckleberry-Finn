<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I says to myself, they&apos;ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they&apos;ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. </p><p> They won&apos;t ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They&apos;ll soon get tired of that, and won&apos;t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson&apos;s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. </p></div> </div>
