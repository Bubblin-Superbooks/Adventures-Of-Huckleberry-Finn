<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Well,&quot; I says, &quot;when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can&apos;t get him home for hours, till he&apos;s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. </p></div> </div>
