<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Hold on a minute; I hain&apos;t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting&apos;s good, but there&apos;s quieter ways if the thing&apos;s got to be done. But what I say is this: it ain&apos;t good sense to go court&apos;n around after a halter if you can git at what you&apos;re up to in some way that&apos;s jist as good and at the same time don&apos;t bring you into no resks. </p><p>&quot;You bet it is. But how you goin&apos; to manage it this time?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Well, my idea is this: we&apos;ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we&apos;ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we&apos;ll wait. Now I say it ain&apos;t a-goin&apos; to be more&apos;n two hours befo&apos; this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. </p></div> </div>
