<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now we&apos;re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that&apos;s a good boy. It wouldn&apos;t do any good to land yonder where the light is&#x2014;it&apos;s only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father&apos;s poor, and I&apos;m bound to say he&apos;s in pretty hard luck. </p><p>&quot;Hold on, Parker,&quot; says the other man, &quot;here&apos;s a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you&apos;ll be all right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s so, my boy&#x2014;good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
