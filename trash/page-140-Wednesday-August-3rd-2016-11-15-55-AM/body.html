I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground&#x2014;hard packed, and no boards. </p><p> Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it&#x2014;all I could drag&#x2014;and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. </p></div> </div>
