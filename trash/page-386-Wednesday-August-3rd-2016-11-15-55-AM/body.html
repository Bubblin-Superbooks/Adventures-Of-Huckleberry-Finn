<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn&apos;t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn&apos;t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be&#x2014;you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. </p><p> He didn&apos;t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners&#x2014;everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always&#x2014;I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn&apos;t nothing go wrong again for a week. </p></div> </div>
