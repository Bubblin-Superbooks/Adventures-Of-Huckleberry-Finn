<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey&apos;s a preacher, ain&apos;t he? Very well, then; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a ship clerk?&#x2014;so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now you know he ain&apos;t. </p><p> What will he do, then? Why, he&apos;ll say, &apos;It&apos;s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it&apos;s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she&apos;s got it.&apos; But never mind, if you think it&apos;s best to tell your uncle Harvey&#x2014;&quot; </p></div> </div>
