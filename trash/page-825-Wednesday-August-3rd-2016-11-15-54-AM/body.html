<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And there&apos;s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don&apos;t send nobody to watch the nigger. </p><p> Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn&apos;t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it&apos;s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent all the difficulties.
