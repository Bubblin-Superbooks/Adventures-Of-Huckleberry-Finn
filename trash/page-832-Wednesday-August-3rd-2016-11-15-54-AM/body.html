<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;What in the nation can he <i>do</i> with it?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Do with it? He can hide it in his bed, can&apos;t he?&quot; That&apos;s what they all do; and he&apos;s got to, too. Huck, you don&apos;t ever seem to want to do anything that&apos;s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. S&apos;pose he don&apos;t do nothing with it? ain&apos;t it there in his bed, for a clew, after he&apos;s gone? and don&apos;t you reckon they&apos;ll want clews? Of course they will. </p></div> </div>
