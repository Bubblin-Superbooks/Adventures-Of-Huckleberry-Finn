<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In about half an hour Tom&apos;s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty yards, and says:</p><p>&quot;Why, there&apos;s somebody come! I wonder who &apos;tis? Why, I do believe it&apos;s a stranger. Jimmy&quot; (that&apos;s one of the children) &quot;run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner.&quot;</p><p> Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger don&apos;t come every year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door. </p></div> </div>
