<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;My plan is this,&quot; I says. &quot;We can easy find out if it&apos;s Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man&apos;s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. </p><p>&quot;<i>Work</i>? Why, cert&apos;nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it&apos;s too blame&apos; simple; there ain&apos;t nothing <i>to</i> it. What&apos;s the good of a plan that ain&apos;t no more trouble than that? It&apos;s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn&apos;t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.&quot;</p></div> </div>
