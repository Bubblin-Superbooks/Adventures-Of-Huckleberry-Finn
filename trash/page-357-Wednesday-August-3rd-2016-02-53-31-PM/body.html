We are right down sorry for you, but we&#x2014;well, hang it, we don&apos;t want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I&apos;ll tell you what to do. Don&apos;t you try to land by yourself, or you&apos;ll smash everything to pieces. </p><p> You float along down about twenty miles, and you&apos;ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don&apos;t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. </p></div> </div>
