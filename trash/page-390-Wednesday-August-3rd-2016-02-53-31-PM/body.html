<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One was Pilgrim&apos;s Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn&apos;t say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship&apos;s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn&apos;t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay&apos;s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn&apos;s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. </p><p> They had pictures hung on the walls&#x2014;mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called &quot;Signing the Declaration.&quot; There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before&#x2014;blacker, mostly, than is common. </p></div> </div>
