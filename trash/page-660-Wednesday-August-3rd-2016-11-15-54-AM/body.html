How fur is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A little short of four miles&#x2014;right out in the country, back here.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Well, that &apos;ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again&#x2014;tell them you&apos;ve thought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don&apos;t turn up wait till eleven, and then if I don&apos;t turn up it means I&apos;m gone, and out of the way, and safe. </p><p>&quot;Good,&quot; she says, &quot;I&apos;ll do it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
