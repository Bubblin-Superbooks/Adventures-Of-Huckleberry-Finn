<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Because it ain&apos;t in the books so&#x2014;that&apos;s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don&apos;t you?&#x2014;that&apos;s the idea. Don&apos;t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what&apos;s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn &apos;em anything? Not by a good deal. </p><p>&quot;All right. I don&apos;t mind; but I say it&apos;s a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn&apos;t let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you&apos;re always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.&quot;</p></div> </div>
