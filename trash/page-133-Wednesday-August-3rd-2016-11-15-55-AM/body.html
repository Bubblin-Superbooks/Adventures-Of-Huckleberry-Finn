<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I just expected there&apos;d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they&apos;d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn&apos;t so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. </p><p> Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this&#x2014;she&apos;s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn&apos;t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I&apos;d hide her good, and then, &apos;stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I&apos;d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot. </p></div> </div>
