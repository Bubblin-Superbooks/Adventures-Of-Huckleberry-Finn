<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn&apos;t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn&apos;t ever find me any more. </p></div> </div>
