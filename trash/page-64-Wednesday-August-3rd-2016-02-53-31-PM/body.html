<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don&apos;t Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can&apos;t the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can&apos;t Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain&apos;t nothing in it. </p><p> I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was &quot;spiritual gifts.&quot; This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant&#x2014;I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. </p></div> </div>
