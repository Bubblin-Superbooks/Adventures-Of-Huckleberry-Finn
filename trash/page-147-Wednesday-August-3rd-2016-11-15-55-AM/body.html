The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. </p><p> I heard what they said, too&#x2014;every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now. T&apos;other one said this warn&apos;t one of the short ones, he reckoned&#x2014;and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn&apos;t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. </p></div> </div>
