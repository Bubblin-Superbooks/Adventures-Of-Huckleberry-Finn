You think you&apos;re a good deal of a big-bug, <i>don&apos;t</i> you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe I am, maybe I ain&apos;t,&quot; I says.</p><p> &quot;Don&apos;t you give me none o&apos; your lip,&quot; says he. &quot;You&apos;ve put on considerable many frills since I been away. I&apos;ll take you down a peg before I get done with you. You&apos;re educated, too, they say&#x2014;can read and write.
