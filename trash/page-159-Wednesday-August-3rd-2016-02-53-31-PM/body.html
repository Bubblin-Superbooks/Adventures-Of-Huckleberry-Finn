<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I heard what they said, too&#x2014;every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now. T&apos;other one said this warn&apos;t one of the short ones, he reckoned&#x2014;and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn&apos;t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. </p><p> The first fellow said he &apos;lowed to tell it to his old woman&#x2014;she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn&apos;t nothing to some things he had said in his time.
