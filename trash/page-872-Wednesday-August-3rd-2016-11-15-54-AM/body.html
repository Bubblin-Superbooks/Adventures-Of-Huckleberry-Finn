<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn&apos;t to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don&apos;t see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they&apos;re on me; and I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve ever lost one of them <i>off</i> of me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, it ain&apos;t <i>your</i> fault if you haven&apos;t, Silas; you&apos;d a done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain&apos;t all that&apos;s gone, nuther. Ther&apos;s a spoon gone; and <i>that</i> ain&apos;t all. There was ten, and now ther&apos;s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, <i>that&apos;s</i> certain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, what else is gone, Sally?&quot;</p></div> </div>
