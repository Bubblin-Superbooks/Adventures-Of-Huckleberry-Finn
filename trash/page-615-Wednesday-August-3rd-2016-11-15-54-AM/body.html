And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind&apos;s made up; I&apos;ll hive that money for them or bust.</p><p> So then I lit out&#x2014;for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No&#x2014;that won&apos;t do.
