<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn&apos;t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn&apos;t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don&apos;t know nothing about it. </p><p> Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. </p></div> </div>
