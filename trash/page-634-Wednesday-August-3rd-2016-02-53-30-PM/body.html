<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile&#x2014;twenty elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says:</p><p> &quot;Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that&apos;s left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that&apos;s left fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by &apos;em if he hadn&apos;t ben afeard o&apos; woundin&apos; his dear William and me. </p></div> </div>
