When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. </p><p>&quot;Who dah?&quot;</p><p> He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn&apos;t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn&apos;t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. </p></div> </div>
