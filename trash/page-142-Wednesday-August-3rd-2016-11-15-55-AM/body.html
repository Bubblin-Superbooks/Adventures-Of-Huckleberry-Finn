There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don&apos;t know where, but it didn&apos;t go to the river. </p><p> The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap&apos;s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn&apos;t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again. </p></div> </div>
