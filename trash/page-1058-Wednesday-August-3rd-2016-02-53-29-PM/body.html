<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars&#x2014;and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home&#x2014;better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I was, with both of &apos;m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. </p></div> </div>
