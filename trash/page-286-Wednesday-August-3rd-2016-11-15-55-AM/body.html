We hadn&apos;t ever been this rich before in neither of our lives. </p><p> The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn&apos;t want no more adventures. </p></div> </div>
