I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn&apos;t see no advantage about it&#x2014;except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn&apos;t worry about it any more, but just let it go. </p><p> Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body&apos;s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow&apos;s Providence, but if Miss Watson&apos;s got him there warn&apos;t no help for him any more. </p></div> </div>
