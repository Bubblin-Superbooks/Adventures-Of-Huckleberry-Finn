<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;No&apos;m, I ain&apos;t hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain&apos;t hungry no more. It&apos;s what makes me so late. My mother&apos;s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. </p><p>&quot;No; but I don&apos;t know everybody yet. I haven&apos;t lived here quite two weeks. It&apos;s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; I says; &quot;I&apos;ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain&apos;t afeared of the dark.&quot;</p></div> </div>
