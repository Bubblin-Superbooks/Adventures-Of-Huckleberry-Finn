<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim&#x2014;if it was Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim&apos;s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house. </p><p> This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn&apos;t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. </p></div> </div>
