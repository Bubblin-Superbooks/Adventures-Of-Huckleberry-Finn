<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I hope to gracious if I warn&apos;t afraid they&apos;d steal some o&apos; the family! I was just to that pass I didn&apos;t have no reasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough now, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there&apos;s my two poor boys asleep, &apos;way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy &apos;t I crep&apos; up there and locked &apos;em in! I did. </p></div> </div>
