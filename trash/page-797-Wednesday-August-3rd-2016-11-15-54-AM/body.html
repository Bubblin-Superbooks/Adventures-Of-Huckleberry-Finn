<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn&apos;t looking for <i>you</i> at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.&quot;</p><p> &quot;It&apos;s because it warn&apos;t intended for any of us to come but Tom,&quot; he says; &quot;but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. </p></div> </div>
