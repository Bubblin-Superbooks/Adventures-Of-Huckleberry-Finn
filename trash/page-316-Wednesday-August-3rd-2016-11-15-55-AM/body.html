En I hain&apos;t ever had no dream b&apos;fo&apos; dat&apos;s tired me like dis one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, well, that&apos;s all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim.&quot;</p><p> So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must start in and &quot;&apos;terpret&quot; it, because it was sent for a warning.
