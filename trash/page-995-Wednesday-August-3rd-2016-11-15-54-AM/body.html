SHOVE!&#x2014;and don&apos;t you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain&apos;t no slave; he&apos;s as free as any cretur that walks this earth!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What <i>does</i> the child mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean every word I <i>say</i>, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don&apos;t go, <i>I&apos;ll</i> go. I&apos;ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and <i>said</i> so; and she set him free in her will.&quot;</p></div> </div>
