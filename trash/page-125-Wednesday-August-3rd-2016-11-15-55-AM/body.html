<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t&apos;other. </p><p> He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn&apos;t run my way. He didn&apos;t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn&apos;t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning. </p></div> </div>
