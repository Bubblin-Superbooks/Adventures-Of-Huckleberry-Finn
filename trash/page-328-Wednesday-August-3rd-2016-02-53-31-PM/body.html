It warn&apos;t no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.</p><p> I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don&apos;t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don&apos;t think to yourself how fast you&apos;re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag&apos;s tearing along. </p></div> </div>
