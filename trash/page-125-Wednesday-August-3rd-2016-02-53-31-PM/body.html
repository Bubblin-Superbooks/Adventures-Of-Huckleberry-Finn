<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it&apos;s like. Here&apos;s the law a-standing ready to take a man&apos;s son away from him&#x2014;a man&apos;s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. </p><p> Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin&apos; for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! That ain&apos;t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o&apos; my property. </p></div> </div>
