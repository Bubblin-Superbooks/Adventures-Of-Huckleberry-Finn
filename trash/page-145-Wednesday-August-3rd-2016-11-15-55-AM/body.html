<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it&apos;s a still night. </p><p> I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was&#x2014;a skiff, away across the water. I couldn&apos;t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn&apos;t but one man in it. Think&apos;s I, maybe it&apos;s pap, though I warn&apos;t expecting him. </p></div> </div>
