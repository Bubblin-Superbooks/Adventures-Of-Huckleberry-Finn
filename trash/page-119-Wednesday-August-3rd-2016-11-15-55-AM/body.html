<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sometimes I&apos;ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I told &apos;em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of &apos;em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I&apos;d leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. </p><p> Them&apos;s the very words. I says look at my hat&#x2014;if you call it a hat&#x2014;but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it&apos;s below my chin, and then it ain&apos;t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o&apos; stove-pipe. </p></div> </div>
