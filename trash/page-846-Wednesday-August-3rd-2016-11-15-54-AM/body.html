<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So we can&apos;t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can&apos;t. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can let on, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. </p><p>&quot;Now, there&apos;s <i>sense</i> in that,&quot; I says. &quot;Letting on don&apos;t cost nothing; letting on ain&apos;t no trouble; and if it&apos;s any object, I don&apos;t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn&apos;t strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I&apos;ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.&quot;</p></div> </div>
