We asked some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for them.</p><p> So we poked along back home, and I warn&apos;t feeling so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow&#x2014;though I hadn&apos;t done nothing. But that&apos;s always the way; it don&apos;t make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person&apos;s conscience ain&apos;t got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. </p></div> </div>
