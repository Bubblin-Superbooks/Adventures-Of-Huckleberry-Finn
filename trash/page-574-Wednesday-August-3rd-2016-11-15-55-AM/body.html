Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:</p><p>&quot;Is it <i>them</i>?&quot;</p><p>And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:</p><p>&quot;You bet it is.&quot;</p></div> </div>
