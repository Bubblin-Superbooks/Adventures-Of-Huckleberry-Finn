There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek&#x2014;but I couldn&apos;t see no snakes. </p><p> He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering &quot;Take him off! take him off! he&apos;s biting me on the neck!&quot; I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. </p></div> </div>
