<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I struck the town I see there warn&apos;t nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark&#x2014;which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn&apos;t know why. </p><p> But at last, just as I was sailing by, flash comes the light in Mary Jane&apos;s window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn&apos;t ever going to be before me no more in this world. </p></div> </div>
