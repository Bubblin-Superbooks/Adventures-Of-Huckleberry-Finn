<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;All right&#x2014;that&apos;s mighty good; they won&apos;t find me, and they&apos;ll think I&apos;ve been killed, and floated down the river&#x2014;there&apos;s something up there that &apos;ll help them think so&#x2014;so don&apos;t you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.&quot;</p><p> I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn&apos;t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens&#x2014;there ain&apos;t nothing in the world so good when it&apos;s cooked right&#x2014;and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time. </p></div> </div>
