<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work&#x2014;weeks of it&#x2014;hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can&apos;t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can&apos;t think half the fun it was. </p><p> And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket&#x2014;&quot; </p></div> </div>
