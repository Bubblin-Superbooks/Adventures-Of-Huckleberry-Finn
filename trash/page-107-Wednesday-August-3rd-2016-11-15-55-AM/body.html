He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. </p><p> I didn&apos;t want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I&apos;d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business&#x2014;appeared like they warn&apos;t ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I&apos;d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. </p></div> </div>
