When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn&apos;t cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn&apos;t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn&apos;t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he&apos;d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn&apos;t do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have help somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he&apos;ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. </p></div> </div>
