<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;It&apos;s a lie, Jim Turner. You&apos;ve acted this way before. You always want more&apos;n your share of the truck, and you&apos;ve always got it, too, because you&apos;ve swore &apos;t if you didn&apos;t you&apos;d tell. But this time you&apos;ve said it jest one time too many. You&apos;re the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.&quot;</p><p> By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn&apos;t back out now, and so I won&apos;t either; I&apos;m a-going to see what&apos;s going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn&apos;t but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. </p></div> </div>
