<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn&apos;t no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.</p><p> But if they was joyful, it warn&apos;t nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn&apos;t hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family&#x2014;I mean the Sawyer family&#x2014;than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. </p></div> </div>
