Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because they didn&apos;t know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I&apos;d a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well. </p><p> Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself, s&apos;pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? And s&apos;pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?. </p></div> </div>
