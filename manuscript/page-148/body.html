<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I took fish-lines and matches and other things&#x2014;everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn&apos;t any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. </p><p> I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn&apos;t quite touch ground. </p></div> </div>
