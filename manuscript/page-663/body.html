<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No; there ain&apos;t no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won&apos;t suspicion that I done it. They&apos;ve got a good thing here, and they ain&apos;t a-going to leave till they&apos;ve played this family and this town for all they&apos;re worth, so I&apos;ll find a chance time enough. </p><p> I&apos;ll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I&apos;m away down the river, I&apos;ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it&apos;s hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn&apos;t let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet. </p></div> </div>
