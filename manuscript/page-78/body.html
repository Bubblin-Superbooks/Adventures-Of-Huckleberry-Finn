Why, you&apos;d <i>have</i> to come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then; I <i>would</i> come; but I lay I&apos;d make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shucks, it ain&apos;t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don&apos;t seem to know anything, somehow&#x2014;perfect saphead.&quot;</p><p> I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn&apos;t no use, none of the genies come. </p><p>CHAPTER IV.</p></div> </div>
