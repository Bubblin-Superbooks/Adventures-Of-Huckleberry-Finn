Ther' ain't no question 'bout it in my mind. Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o' uncles would it be that 'd rob—yes, rob—sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time? If I know William—and I think I do—he—well, I'll jest ask him.</p></div> </div>
