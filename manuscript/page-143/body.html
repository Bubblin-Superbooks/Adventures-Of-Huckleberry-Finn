I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. </p><p> I says to myself, they&apos;ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they&apos;ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. </p></div> </div>
