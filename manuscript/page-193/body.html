<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time. <p>Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?</p><p>So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.</p></div> </div>
