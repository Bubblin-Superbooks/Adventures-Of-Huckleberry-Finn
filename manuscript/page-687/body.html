<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In a minute or two here comes this undertaker&apos;s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people&apos;s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, &quot;He had a rat!&quot; Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. </p><p> You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don&apos;t cost nothing, and it&apos;s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn&apos;t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was. </p></div> </div>
