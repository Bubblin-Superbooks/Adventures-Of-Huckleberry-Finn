<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Tom he made a sign to me&#x2014;kind of a little noise with his mouth&#x2014;and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they&apos;d find out I warn&apos;t in. </p><p> Then Tom said he hadn&apos;t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn&apos;t want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. </p></div> </div>
