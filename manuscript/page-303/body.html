<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come I see I warn&apos;t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it&#x2014;and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t&apos;other, but it was going straight ahead all the time. </p><p>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop <i>behind</i> me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else&apos;s whoop, or else I was turned around.</p></div> </div>
