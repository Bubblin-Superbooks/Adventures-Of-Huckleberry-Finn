We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn&apos;t want nothing but a crust, and we couldn&apos;t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. </p></div> </div>
