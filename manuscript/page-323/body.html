<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn&apos;t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me&#x2014;and then there warn&apos;t no raft in sight; you couldn&apos;t see twenty yards. </p><p> I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn&apos;t come. I was in such a hurry I hadn&apos;t untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn&apos;t hardly do anything with them. </p></div> </div>
