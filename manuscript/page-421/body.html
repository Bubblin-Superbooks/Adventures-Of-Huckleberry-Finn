There ain&apos;t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons&#x2014;not a one. And there ain&apos;t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep&apos; up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. </p><p> They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep&apos; his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. </p></div> </div>
