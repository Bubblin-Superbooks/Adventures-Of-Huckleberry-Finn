<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o&apos;clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents&apos; worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn&apos;t roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don&apos;t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain&apos;t ever forgot. </p></div> </div>
