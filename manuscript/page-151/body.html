<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me. </p><p> I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. </p><p> I heard what they said, tooâ€”every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now.</p></div> </div>
