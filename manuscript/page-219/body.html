<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake&apos;s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. </p><p> I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn&apos;t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it. </p></div> </div>
