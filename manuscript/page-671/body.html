The king says:</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because Mary Jane &apos;ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put &apos;em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Your head&apos;s level agin, duke,&quot; says the king; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I&apos;d better do if they did catch me. </p></div> </div>
