<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Because you hain&apos;t got but one on. Just listen at the man! I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo&apos;s-line yesterday&#x2014;I see it there myself. But it&apos;s gone, that&apos;s the long and the short of it, and you&apos;ll just have to change to a red flann&apos;l one till I can get time to make a new one. </p><p> And it &apos;ll be the third I&apos;ve made in two years. It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to do with &apos;m all is more&apos;n I can make out. A body &apos;d think you would learn to take some sort of care of &apos;em at your time of life.&quot; </p></div> </div>
