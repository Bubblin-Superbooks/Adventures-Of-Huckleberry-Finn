<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn&apos;t come back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it was as much as half-after eight, then&#x2014;here comes a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail&#x2014;that is, I knowed it was the king and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn&apos;t look like nothing in the world that was human&#x2014;just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. </p></div> </div>
