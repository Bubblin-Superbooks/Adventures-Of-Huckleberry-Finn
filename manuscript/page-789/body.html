<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. </p><p>&quot;Set her loose, Jim! we&apos;re all right now!&quot;</p><p> But there warn&apos;t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout&#x2014;and then another&#x2014;and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn&apos;t no use&#x2014;old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn&apos;t help it. </p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whereabouts?&quot; says I.</p></div> </div>
