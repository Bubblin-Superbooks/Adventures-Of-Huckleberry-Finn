The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So she'd had a rough time.</p><p>I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</p><p>"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn't you stir me up?"</p><p>"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain' dead—you ain' drownded—you's back agin? It's too good for true, honey, it's too good for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you. No, you ain' dead! you's back agin, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck—de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!"</p></div> </div>
