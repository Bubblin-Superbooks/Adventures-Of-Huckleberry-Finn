<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says: </p><p>"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons yet."</p><p>She says:</p><p>"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted 'm myself."</p><p>"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine."</p></div> </div>
