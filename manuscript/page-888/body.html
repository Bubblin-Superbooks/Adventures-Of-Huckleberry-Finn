<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jim ain't got no use for a rope ladder."</p><p>"He has got use for it. How you talk, you better say; you don't know nothing about it. He's got to have a rope ladder; they all do."</p><p>"What in the nation can he do with it?"</p><p> "Do with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he?" That's what they all do; and he's got to, too. Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. S'pose he don't do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed, for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews? Of course they will. </p></div> </div>
