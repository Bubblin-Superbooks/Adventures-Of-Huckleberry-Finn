<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said &quot;Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.&quot; Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said &quot;I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.&quot; There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said &quot;And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.&quot; These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn&apos;t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. </p></div> </div>
