Come in."</p><p> As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows—there warn't none on the side. </p><p> They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, "Why, he ain't a Shepherdson—no, there ain't any Shepherdson about him."
