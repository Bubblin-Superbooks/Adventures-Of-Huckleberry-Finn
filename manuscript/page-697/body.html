<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?"</p><p>"Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?"</p><p>"Never mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this house—and prove how I know it—will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?"</p><p>"Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"</p><p>"All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more out of you than just your word—I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible." She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, "If you don't mind it, I'll shut the door—and bolt it."</p></div> </div>
