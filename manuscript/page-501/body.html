<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn&apos;t nothing else but mud&#x2014;mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. You&apos;d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she&apos;d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. </p></div> </div>
