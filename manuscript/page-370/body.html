<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her. </p><p>I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn&apos;t get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was &quot;treading water,&quot; and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.</p></div> </div>
