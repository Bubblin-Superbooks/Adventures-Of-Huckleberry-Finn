<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns&#x2014;the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river&#x2014;both of them hurt&#x2014;and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, &quot;Kill them, kill them!&quot; It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. </p><p> I ain&apos;t a-going to tell all that happened&#x2014;it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn&apos;t ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain&apos;t ever going to get shut of them&#x2014;lots of times I dream about them. </p></div> </div>
