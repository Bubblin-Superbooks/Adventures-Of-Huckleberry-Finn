Cur&apos;us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at &apos;im?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>I hunched Tom, and whispers:</p><p>&quot;You going, right here in the daybreak? <i>that</i> warn&apos;t the plan.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it warn&apos;t; but it&apos;s the plan <i>now</i>.&quot;</p><p>So, drat him, we went along, but I didn&apos;t like it much. When we got in we couldn&apos;t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:</p><p>&quot;Why, <i>Huck</i>! En good <i>lan</i>&apos;! ain&apos; dat Misto Tom?&quot;</p></div> </div>
