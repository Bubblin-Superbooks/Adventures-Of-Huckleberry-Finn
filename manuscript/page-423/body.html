<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn&apos;t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens&#x2014;there ain&apos;t nothing in the world so good when it&apos;s cooked right&#x2014;and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time. </p><p> I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn&apos;t no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don&apos;t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft. </p></div> </div>
