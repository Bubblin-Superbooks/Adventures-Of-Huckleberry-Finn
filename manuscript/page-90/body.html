There warn't no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl—a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. </p><p> As for his clothes—just rags, that was all.

His hat was laying on the floor—an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid. </p><p>I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair tilted back a little.</p></div> </div>
