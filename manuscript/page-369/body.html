Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says: </p><p>"Can you spell, Buck?"</p><p>"Yes," he says.</p><p>"I bet you can't spell my name," says I.</p><p>"I bet you what you dare I can," says he.</p><p>"All right," says I, "go ahead."</p><p>"G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n—there now," he says.</p><p>"Well," says I, "you done it, but I didn't think you could. It ain't no slouch of a name to spell—right off without studying."</p></div> </div>
