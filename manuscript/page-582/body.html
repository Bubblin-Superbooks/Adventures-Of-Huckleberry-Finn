Well, it is their turn, and I&apos;d give something to know how much they&apos;d take for it. </p><p>Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before. By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t it s&apos;prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; I says, &quot;it don&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why don&apos;t it, Huck?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, it don&apos;t, because it&apos;s in the breed.
