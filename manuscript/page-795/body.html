<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper. </p><p>It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:</p><p>"All right, then, I'll go to hell"â€”and tore it up.</p><p> It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. </p></div> </div>
