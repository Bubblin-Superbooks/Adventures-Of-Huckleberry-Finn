<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No&#x2014;I dasn&apos;t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they&apos;ve got the money, and they&apos;d slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help I&apos;d get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge. </p><p> No; there ain&apos;t no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won&apos;t suspicion that I done it. They&apos;ve got a good thing here, and they ain&apos;t a-going to leave till they&apos;ve played this family and this town for all they&apos;re worth, so I&apos;ll find a chance time enough. </p></div> </div>
