His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I&apos;d druther been bit with a snake than pap&apos;s whisky. </p><p> Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn&apos;t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. </p></div> </div>
