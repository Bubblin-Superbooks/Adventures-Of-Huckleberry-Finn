<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Watchman your grandmother,&quot; I says; &quot;there ain&apos;t nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody&apos;s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it&apos;s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?&quot; Jim couldn&apos;t say nothing to that, so he didn&apos;t try. </p><p> &quot;And besides,&quot; I says, &quot;we might borrow something worth having out of the captain&apos;s stateroom. Seegars, I bet you&#x2014;and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and they don&apos;t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. </p></div> </div>
