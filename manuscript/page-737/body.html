Think o&apos; that, now! You bet <i>I&apos;d</i> wait, if it was seven year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s me, every time,&quot; says I. &quot;But maybe his chance ain&apos;t worth no more than that, if he&apos;ll sell it so cheap. Maybe there&apos;s something ain&apos;t straight about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But it <i>is</i>, though&#x2014;straight as a string. I see the handbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot&#x2014;paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he&apos;s frum, below Newr<i>leans</i>. No-sirree-<i>bob</i>, they ain&apos;t no trouble &apos;bout <i>that</i> speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won&apos;t ye?&quot;</p></div> </div>
