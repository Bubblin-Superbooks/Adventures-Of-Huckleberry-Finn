<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Poor thing, many&apos;s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn&apos;t going to let anything come between us. </p><p> Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn&apos;t seem right that there warn&apos;t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn&apos;t seem to make it go somehow. </p></div> </div>
