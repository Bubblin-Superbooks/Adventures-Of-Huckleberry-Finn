<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn&apos;t no knives and forks on the place&#x2014;pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. </p><p> Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes&#x2014;and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don&apos;t know where, but it didn&apos;t go to the river. </p></div> </div>
