But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says:</p><p> &quot;It ain&apos;t no use, Huck, it ain&apos;t a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we&apos;d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn&apos;t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn&apos;t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. </p></div> </div>
