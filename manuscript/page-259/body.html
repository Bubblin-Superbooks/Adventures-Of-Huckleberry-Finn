A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.</p><p> We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn&apos;t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. </p></div> </div>
