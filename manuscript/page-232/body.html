In this neighborhood?&apos;</p><p>&quot;No&apos;m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I&apos;ve walked all the way and I&apos;m all tired out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hungry, too, I reckon. I&apos;ll find you something.&quot;</p><p> &quot;No&apos;m, I ain&apos;t hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain&apos;t hungry no more. It&apos;s what makes me so late. My mother&apos;s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. </p><p>&quot;No; but I don&apos;t know everybody yet. I haven&apos;t lived here quite two weeks. It&apos;s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.&quot;</p></div> </div>
