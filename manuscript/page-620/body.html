<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:</p><p>&quot;Is it <i>them</i>?&quot;</p><p>And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:</p><p>&quot;You bet it is.&quot;</p><p> When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane was red-headed, but that don&apos;t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come. </p></div> </div>
