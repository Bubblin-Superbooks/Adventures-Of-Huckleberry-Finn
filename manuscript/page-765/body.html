<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew&#x2014;leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!</p><p> When I struck the town I see there warn&apos;t nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark&#x2014;which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn&apos;t know why. </p></div> </div>
