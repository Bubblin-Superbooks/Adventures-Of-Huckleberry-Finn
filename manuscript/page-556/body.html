<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;The idea of you lynching anybody! It&apos;s amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! Because you&apos;re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man? Why, a man&apos;s safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind&#x2014;as long as it&apos;s daytime and you&apos;re not behind him. </p><p> &quot;Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South, and I&apos;ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man&apos;s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. </p></div> </div>
