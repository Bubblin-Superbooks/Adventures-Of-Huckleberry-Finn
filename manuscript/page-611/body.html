Blamed if he didn&apos;t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter&apos;s business&#x2014;which was a tanner; and about George&apos;s&#x2014;which was a carpenter; and about Harvey&apos;s&#x2014;which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:</p><p>&quot;What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because she&apos;s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn&apos;t stop there. When they&apos;re deep they won&apos;t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Was Peter Wilks well off?&quot;</p></div> </div>
