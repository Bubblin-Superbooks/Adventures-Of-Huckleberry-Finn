<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn&apos;t no confidence. You do that when you&apos;ve lost a horseshoe that you&apos;ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn&apos;t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you&apos;d killed a spider. </p><p> I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn&apos;t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;twelve licks; and all still again&#x2014;stiller than ever. </p></div> </div>
