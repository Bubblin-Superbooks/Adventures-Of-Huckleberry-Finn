<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you long's I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.</p><p> Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. </p><p>"Hereâ€”come in here."</p><p> And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.</p></div> </div>
