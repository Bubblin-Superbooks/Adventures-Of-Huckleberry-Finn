I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say:</p><p>"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"</p><p>Another voice said, pretty loud:</p><p>"It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way before. You always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time you've said it jest one time too many. You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country."</p><p> By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now, and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.</p></div> </div>
