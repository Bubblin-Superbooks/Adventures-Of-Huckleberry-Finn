<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families&#x2014;and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that&apos;s laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. </p><p> Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn&apos;t cool it a bit, neither, the way I&apos;ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times. There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn&apos;t no use, they didn&apos;t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. </p></div> </div>
