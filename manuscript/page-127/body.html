I says look at my hat&#x2014;if you call it a hat&#x2014;but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it&apos;s below my chin, and then it ain&apos;t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o&apos; stove-pipe. </p><p> &quot;Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio&#x2014;a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain&apos;t a man in that town that&apos;s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane&#x2014;the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. </p></div> </div>
