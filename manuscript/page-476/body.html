So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort him. But he said it warn&apos;t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him &quot;Your Majesty,&quot; and waited on him first at meals, and didn&apos;t set down in his presence till he asked them. </p></div> </div>
