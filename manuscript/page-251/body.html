<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well, I reckon you <i>have</i> lived in the country. I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. What&apos;s your real name, now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;George Peters, mum.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Well, try to remember it, George. Don&apos;t forget and tell me it&apos;s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it&apos;s George Elexander when I catch you. And don&apos;t go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. </p><p> Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don&apos;t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that&apos;s the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t&apos;other way. </p></div> </div>
