I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, &quot;Dah&apos;s Cairo!&quot; it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it <i>was</i> Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.</p></div> </div>
