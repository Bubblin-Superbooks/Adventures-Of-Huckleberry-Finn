<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;It ain&apos;t yo&apos; fault, Huck; you didn&apos; know. Don&apos;t you blame yo&apos;self &apos;bout it.&quot;</p><p>When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo.</p><p> We talked it all over. It wouldn&apos;t do to take to the shore; we couldn&apos;t take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn&apos;t no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!. </p></div> </div>
