So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with &quot;HALF-PAST TWO&quot; wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn&apos;t find anything else. </p><p> I couldn&apos;t make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. </p></div> </div>
