<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn&apos;t scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. </p><p> She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn&apos;t so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn&apos;t any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn&apos;t make it work. </p></div> </div>
