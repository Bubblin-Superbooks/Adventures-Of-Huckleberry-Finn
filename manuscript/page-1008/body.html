Who'd you reckon?"</p><p>Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</p><p>"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? Hasn't he got away?"</p><p>"Him?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger? 'Deed he hasn't. They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or sold!"</p><p>Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</p><p>"They hain't no right to shut him up! SHOVE!â€”and don't you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur that walks this earth!"</p></div> </div>
