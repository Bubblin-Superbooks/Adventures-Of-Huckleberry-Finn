<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Now,&quot; says the duke, &quot;after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. </p><p>We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn&apos;t be no trouble about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke&apos;s work in the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted to.</p></div> </div>
