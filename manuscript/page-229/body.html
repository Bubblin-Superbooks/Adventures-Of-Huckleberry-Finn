I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. <p> I hain't seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's going over to seeâ€”him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago." </p><p> I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still.
