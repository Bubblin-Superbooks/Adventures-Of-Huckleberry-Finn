<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain&apos;t no watchman to be drugged&#x2014;now there ought to be a watchman. There ain&apos;t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. </p><p> And there&apos;s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don&apos;t send nobody to watch the nigger. </p></div> </div>
