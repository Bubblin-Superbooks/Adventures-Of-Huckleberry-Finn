<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Packard didn&apos;t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn&apos;t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. </p><p>&quot;Here&#x2014;come in here.&quot;</p><p> And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn&apos;t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they&apos;d been having. </p></div> </div>
