Strike a light there, somebody. What did you say your name was?&quot;</p><p>&quot;George Jackson, sir. I&apos;m only a boy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look here, if you&apos;re telling the truth you needn&apos;t be afraid&#x2014;nobody&apos;ll hurt you. But don&apos;t try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, sir, nobody.&quot;</p><p>I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The man sung out:</p><p>&quot;Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool&#x2014;ain&apos;t you got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your places.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All ready.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?&quot;</p></div> </div>
