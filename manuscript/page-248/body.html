<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen. </p><p>&quot;Goshen, child? This ain&apos;t Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen&apos;s ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.&quot;</p></div> </div>
