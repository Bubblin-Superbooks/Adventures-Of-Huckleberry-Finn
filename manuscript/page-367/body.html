<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We didn&apos;t say a word for a good while. There warn&apos;t anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck&#x2014;and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.</p><p>By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn&apos;t no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. We warn&apos;t going to borrow it when there warn&apos;t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.</p><p>So we shoved out after dark on the raft.</p></div> </div>
