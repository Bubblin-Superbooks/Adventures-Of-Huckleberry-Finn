<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We didn&apos;t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, &apos;They&apos;ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they&apos;ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I&apos;ve got in the world, and now I&apos;m in a strange country, and ain&apos;t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;&apos; so I set down and cried. </p></div> </div>
