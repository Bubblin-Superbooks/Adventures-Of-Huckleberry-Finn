<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So she&apos;d had a rough time.</p><p>I made fast and laid down under Jim&apos;s nose on the raft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</p><p>&quot;Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn&apos;t you stir me up?&quot;</p></div> </div>
