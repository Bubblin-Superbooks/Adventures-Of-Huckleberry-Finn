<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know—and there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. <p>I says:</p><p>"What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under the cabin?"</p><p>But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighs again, and says:</p><p>"No, it wouldn't do—there ain't necessity enough for it."</p></div> </div>
