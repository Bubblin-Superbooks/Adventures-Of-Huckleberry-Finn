<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn&apos;t stood it much longer. </p><p> Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, &quot;Don&apos;t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry&#x2014;set up straight;&quot; and pretty soon she would say, &quot;Don&apos;t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry&#x2014;why don&apos;t you try to behave?&quot; Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. </p></div> </div>
