Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn&apos;t run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing&#x2014;heard them plain; but we couldn&apos;t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. </p><p>&quot;No; spirits wouldn&apos;t say, &apos;Dern the dern fog.&apos;&quot;</p></div> </div>
