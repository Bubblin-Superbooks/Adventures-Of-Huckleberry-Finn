Look yonder!—up the road!—ain't that somebody coming?"</p><p>He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared, and says:</p><p>"Why, who's that?"</p><p>"Who do you reckon 't is?"</p><p>"I hain't no idea. Who is it?"</p><p>"It's Tom Sawyer!"</p><p>By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn't no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.</p></div> </div>
