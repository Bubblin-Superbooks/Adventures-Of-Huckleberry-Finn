And mind, don&apos;t you hurry&#x2014;come mighty slow. If there&apos;s anybody with you, let him keep back&#x2014;if he shows himself he&apos;ll be shot. Come along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself&#x2014;just enough to squeeze in, d&apos; you hear?&quot;</p><p> I didn&apos;t hurry; I couldn&apos;t if I&apos;d a wanted to. I took one slow step at a time and there warn&apos;t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. </p></div> </div>
