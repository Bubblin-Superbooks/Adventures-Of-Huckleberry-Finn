<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn&apos;t no use; he said it wouldn&apos;t talk. He said sometimes it wouldn&apos;t talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn&apos;t no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn&apos;t pass nohow, even if the brass didn&apos;t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. </p></div> </div>
