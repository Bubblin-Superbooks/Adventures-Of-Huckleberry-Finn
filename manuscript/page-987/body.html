<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to warn anybody for that something's up? Let them find it out for themselves—it's their lookout."</p><p> "Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted from the very start—left us to do everything. They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. So if we don't give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing—won't be nothing to it." </p></div> </div>
