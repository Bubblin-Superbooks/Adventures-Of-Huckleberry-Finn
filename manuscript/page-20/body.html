<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>Scene: The Mississippi Valley Time: Forty to fifty years ago</p>
<p> YOU don&apos;t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain&apos;t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. </p><p> That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly&#x2014;Tom&apos;s Aunt Polly, she is&#x2014;and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before. </p></div> </div>
