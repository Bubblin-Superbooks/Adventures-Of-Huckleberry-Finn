<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn&apos;t robbed nobody, hadn&apos;t killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. </p></div> </div>
