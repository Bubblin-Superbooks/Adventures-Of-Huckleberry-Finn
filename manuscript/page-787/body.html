<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn&apos;t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway&#x2014;and maybe a chance for the change on top of it. </p><p> So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn&apos;t walk, and couldn&apos;t do nothing to them. </p></div> </div>
