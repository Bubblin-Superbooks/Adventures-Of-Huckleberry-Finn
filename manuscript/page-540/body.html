<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Next day you couldn&apos;t hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town. </p><p> The third night the house was crammed again&#x2014;and they warn&apos;t new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat&#x2014;and I see it warn&apos;t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. </p></div> </div>
