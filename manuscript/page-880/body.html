<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we&apos;d got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says: </p><p>&quot;Why, Aunt Sally, there ain&apos;t but nine spoons <i>yet</i>.&quot;</p><p>She says:</p><p>&quot;Go &apos;long to your play, and don&apos;t bother me. I know better, I counted &apos;m myself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can&apos;t make but nine.&quot;</p></div> </div>
