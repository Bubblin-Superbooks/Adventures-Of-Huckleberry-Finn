So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right. There warn&apos;t a sound anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. </p><p> The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn&apos;t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn&apos;t there. </p></div> </div>
