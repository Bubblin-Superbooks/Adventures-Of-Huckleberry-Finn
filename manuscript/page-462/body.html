<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn&apos;t any clothes on, and didn&apos;t mind. We didn&apos;t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them. </p><p> I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn&apos;t no show for me; so I laid outside&#x2014;I didn&apos;t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn&apos;t running so high now. </p></div> </div>
