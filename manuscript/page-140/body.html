<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. He says:</p><p>&quot;What you doin&apos; with this gun?&quot;</p><p>I judged he didn&apos;t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:</p><p>&quot;Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you roust me out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I tried to, but I couldn&apos;t; I couldn&apos;t budge you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, all right. Don&apos;t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there&apos;s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I&apos;ll be along in a minute.&quot;</p></div> </div>
