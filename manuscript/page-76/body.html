If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di&apos;monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor&apos;s daughter from China for you to marry, they&apos;ve got to do it&#x2014;and they&apos;ve got to do it before sun-up next morning, too. </p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves &apos;stead of fooling them away like that.
