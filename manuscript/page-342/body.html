<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> Look here, I'll tell you what to do. Don't you try to land by yourself, or you'll smash everything to pieces. <p> You float along down about twenty miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don't be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. </p><p> Now we're trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy. It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light isâ€”it's only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck. </p></div> </div>
