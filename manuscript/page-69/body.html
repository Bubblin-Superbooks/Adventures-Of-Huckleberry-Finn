<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Tom Sawyer called the hogs &quot;ingots,&quot; and he called the turnips and stuff &quot;julery,&quot; and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn&apos;t see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand &quot;sumter&quot; mules, all loaded down with di&apos;monds, and they didn&apos;t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. </p></div> </div>
