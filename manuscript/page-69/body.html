<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you'd have to come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not."</p><p>"What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then; I would come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country."</p><p>"Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don't seem to know anything, somehowâ€”perfect saphead."</p><p> I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't no use, none of the genies come. </p></div> </div>
