I tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn&apos;t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. </p><p> I slipped up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn&apos;t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn&apos;t start a face in that town that I didn&apos;t know. </p></div> </div>
