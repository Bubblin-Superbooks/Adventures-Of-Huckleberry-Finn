<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But there warn&apos;t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn&apos;t no camels nor no elephants. It warn&apos;t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. </p><p> I didn&apos;t see no di&apos;monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn&apos;t we see them, then? He said if I warn&apos;t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. </p></div> </div>
