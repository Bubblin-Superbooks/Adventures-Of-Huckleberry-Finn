<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn&apos;t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn&apos;t often that we laughed&#x2014;only a little kind of a low chuckle. </p></div> </div>
