<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"GIT up! What you 'bout?"</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. He says:</p><p>"What you doin' with this gun?"</p><p>I judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:</p><p>"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him."</p><p>"Why didn't you roust me out?"</p><p>"Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you."</p><p>"Well, all right. Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast. I'll be along in a minute."</p></div> </div>
