<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn&apos;t far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn&apos;t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. </p><p> My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn&apos;t hear nothing else. </p></div> </div>
