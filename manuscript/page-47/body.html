We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money."</p><p>"Must we always kill the people?"</p><p>"Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it's considered best to kill themâ€”except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed."</p><p>"Ransomed? What's that?"</p><p>"I don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books; and so of course that's what we've got to do."</p></div> </div>
