<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Well, it&apos;s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. </p><p> Yes, I remember now, he did die. Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn&apos;t save him. Yes, it was mortification&#x2014;that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. </p></div> </div>
