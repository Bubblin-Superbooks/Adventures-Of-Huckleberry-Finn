<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't ever going to see each other any more!"</p><p>"But they will—and inside of two weeks—and I know it!" says I.</p><p>Laws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!</p><p> I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. </p><p> So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie.</p></div> </div>
