<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I was getting so uneasy I couldn&apos;t listen good. I had my mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn&apos;t get no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back, because she says:</p><p> &quot;But here we&apos;re a-running on this way, and you hain&apos;t told me a word about Sis, nor any of them. Now I&apos;ll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me everything&#x2014;tell me all about &apos;m all every one of &apos;m; and how they are, and what they&apos;re doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.&quot; </p></div> </div>
