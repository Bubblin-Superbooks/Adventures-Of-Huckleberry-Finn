<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves, I says:</p><p>"Did you want to kill him, Buck?"</p><p>"Well, I bet I did."</p><p>"What did he do to you?"</p><p>"Him? He never done nothing to me."</p><p>"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?"</p><p>"Why, nothing—only it's on account of the feud."</p><p>"What's a feud?"</p><p>"Why, where was you raised? Don't you know what a feud is?"</p><p>"Never heard of it before—tell me about it."</p><p>"Well," says Buck, "a feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills him; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the cousins chip in—and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't no more feud. But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time."</p></div> </div>
