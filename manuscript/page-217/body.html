<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We rummaged the clothes we&apos;d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they&apos;d a knowed the money was there they wouldn&apos;t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn&apos;t want to talk about that. I says:</p><p> &quot;Now you think it&apos;s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands. Well, here&apos;s your bad luck! We&apos;ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. </p></div> </div>
