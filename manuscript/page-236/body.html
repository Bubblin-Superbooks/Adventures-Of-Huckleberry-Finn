<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn't look upâ€”seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But now she says:</p><p>"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?"</p><p>"Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary."</p><p>"Oh, that's the way of it?"</p></div> </div>
