It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckâ€”and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.<p>By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.</p><p>So we shoved out after dark on the raft.</p></div> </div>
