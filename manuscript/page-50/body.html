<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead."</p><p>"Now, that's something like. That'll answer. Why couldn't you said that before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they'll be, tooâ€”eating up everything, and always trying to get loose."</p><p>"How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?"</p><p>"A guard! Well, that is good. So somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that's foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?"</p></div> </div>
