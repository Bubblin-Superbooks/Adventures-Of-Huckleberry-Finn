We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. </p><p> Tom said he was right behind Jim&apos;s bed now, and we&apos;d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn&apos;t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim&apos;s counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you&apos;d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. </p></div> </div>
