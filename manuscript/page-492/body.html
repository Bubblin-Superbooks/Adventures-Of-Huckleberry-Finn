<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There&apos;s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor&apos;s wrong, the proud man&apos;s contumely, The law&apos;s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns, Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i&apos; the adage, Is sicklied o&apos;er with care. </p></div> </div>
