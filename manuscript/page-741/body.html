<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I am Peter Wilks&apos; brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can&apos;t hear nor speak&#x2014;and can&apos;t even make signs to amount to much, now&apos;t he&apos;s only got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. </p><p>So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out:</p><p>&quot;Broke his arm&#x2014;<i>very</i> likely, <i>ain&apos;t</i> it?&#x2014;and very convenient, too, for a fraud that&apos;s got to make signs, and ain&apos;t learnt how. Lost their baggage! That&apos;s <i>mighty</i> good!&#x2014;and mighty ingenious&#x2014;under the <i>circumstances</i>!&quot;</p></div> </div>
