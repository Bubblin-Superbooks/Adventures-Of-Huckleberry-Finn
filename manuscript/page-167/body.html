I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. <p> I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. </p><p> But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place.</p></div> </div>
