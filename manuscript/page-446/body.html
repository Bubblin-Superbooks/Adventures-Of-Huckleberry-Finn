<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it warn&apos;t much use, he couldn&apos;t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. </p><p> He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say &quot;Your Grace,&quot; or &quot;My Lord,&quot; or &quot;Your Lordship&quot;&#x2014;and he wouldn&apos;t mind it if we called him plain &quot;Bridgewater,&quot; which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done. </p></div> </div>
