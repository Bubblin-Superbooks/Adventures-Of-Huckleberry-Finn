Where you been all this time, you rascal?"</p><p>"I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the runaway niggerâ€”me and Sid."</p><p>"Why, where ever did you go?" he says. "Your aunt's been mighty uneasy."</p><p> "She needn't," I says, "because we was all right. We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we're going home."</p></div> </div>
