<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen. <p>"Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?"</p><p>"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen."</p><p>"He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong."</p><p>"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I got to be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight."</p></div> </div>
