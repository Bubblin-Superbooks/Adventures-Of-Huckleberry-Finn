<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I ain&apos;t a-going to tell all that happened&#x2014;it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn&apos;t ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain&apos;t ever going to get shut of them&#x2014;lots of times I dream about them. </p><p> I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn&apos;t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. </p></div> </div>
