<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Buck looked about as old as meâ€”thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn't on anything but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one. He says:</p><p>"Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?"</p><p>They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.</p><p>"Well," he says, "if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one."</p><p>They all laughed, and Bob says:</p><p>"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in coming."</p></div> </div>
