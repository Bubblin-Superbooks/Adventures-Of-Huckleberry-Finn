<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Don&apos;t anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn&apos;t say any more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I&apos;d seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger&apos;s hiding over there; anyway, says I, it&apos;s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. </p><p> I hain&apos;t seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he&apos;s gone, if it was him; but husband&apos;s going over to see&#x2014;him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.&quot; </p></div> </div>
