They&apos;re after us!&quot;</p><p> Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. </p><p>I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn&apos;t see it, for stars and shadows ain&apos;t good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still&#x2014;never saying a word.</p><p>CHAPTER XII.</p></div> </div>
