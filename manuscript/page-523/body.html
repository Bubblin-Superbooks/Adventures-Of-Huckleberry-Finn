<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep, Great nature&apos;s second course, And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of. </p></div> </div>
