<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop <i>behind</i> me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else&apos;s whoop, or else I was turned around.</p><p> I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe&apos;s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. </p></div> </div>
