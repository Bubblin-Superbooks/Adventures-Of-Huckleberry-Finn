The next time it come I see I warn&apos;t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it&#x2014;and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t&apos;other, but it was going straight ahead all the time. </p></div> </div>
