<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain&apos;t robbery; it&apos;s burglary,&quot; says Tom Sawyer. &quot;We ain&apos;t burglars. That ain&apos;t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Must we always kill the people?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, certainly. It&apos;s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it&apos;s considered best to kill them&#x2014;except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they&apos;re ransomed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ransomed? What&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. But that&apos;s what they do. I&apos;ve seen it in books; and so of course that&apos;s what we&apos;ve got to do.&quot;</p></div> </div>
