<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people&#x2014;whereas you&apos;re just as brave, and no braver. Why don&apos;t your juries hang murderers? Because they&apos;re afraid the man&apos;s friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark&#x2014;and it&apos;s just what they would do. </p><p> &quot;So they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that you didn&apos;t bring a man with you; that&apos;s one mistake, and the other is that you didn&apos;t come in the dark and fetch your masks. </p></div> </div>
