Here is the way we put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there&#x2014;sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up&#x2014;nearly always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. </p></div> </div>
