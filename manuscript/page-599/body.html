<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his&apos;n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king&apos;s duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. </p><p> Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he&apos;d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you&apos;d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. </p><p>&quot;Seein&apos; how I&apos;m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we&apos;ll come down to the village on her.&quot;</p></div> </div>
