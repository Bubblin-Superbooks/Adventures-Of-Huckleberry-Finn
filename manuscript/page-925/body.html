<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat&apos;s notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim&apos;s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn&apos;t ever anything could a worked better. </p></div> </div>
