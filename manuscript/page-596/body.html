<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn&apos;t take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. </p><p> You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn&apos;t look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he&apos;d cipher out some way to get around it. </p></div> </div>
