<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I didn&apos;t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn&apos;t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn&apos;t say nothing; then I says:</p><p>&quot;I&apos;d ruther not <i>tell</i> you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don&apos;t mind letting me off; but I&apos;ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop&apos;s, if you want to. Do you reckon that &apos;ll do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;</p></div> </div>
