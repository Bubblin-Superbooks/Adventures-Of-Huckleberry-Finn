<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Our hole was pretty big, but it warn&apos;t big enough to get the grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it. </p><p>&quot;You got any spiders in here, Jim?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain&apos;t, Mars Tom.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, we&apos;ll get you some.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But bless you, honey, I doan&apos; <i>want</i> none. I&apos;s afeard un um. I jis&apos; &apos;s soon have rattlesnakes aroun&apos;.&quot;</p></div> </div>
