<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meâ€”and then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. </p><p> I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn't come. I was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them. </p><p>As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down the towhead.</p></div> </div>
