<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn&apos;t set down and watch a camp fire&#x2014;no, sir, she&apos;d fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn&apos;t she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn&apos;t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village&#x2014;no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. </p></div> </div>
