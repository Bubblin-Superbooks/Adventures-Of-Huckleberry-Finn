<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Why, it&apos;s because you ain&apos;t one of these leather-face people. I don&apos;t want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;There, there, don&apos;t! Yes, I&apos;ll go before breakfast&#x2014;I&apos;ll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Yes; never mind about them. They&apos;ve got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don&apos;t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. </p></div> </div>
