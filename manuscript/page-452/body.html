<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what&apos;s the use o&apos; your bein&apos; sour? It &apos;ll only make things oncomfortable. It ain&apos;t my fault I warn&apos;t born a duke, it ain&apos;t your fault you warn&apos;t born a king&#x2014;so what&apos;s the use to worry? Make the best o&apos; things the way you find &apos;em, says I&#x2014;that&apos;s my motto. </p><p>The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.</p></div> </div>
