These sparks was our clock&#x2014;the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.</p><p> One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore&#x2014;it was only two hundred yards&#x2014;and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn&apos;t get some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it. </p></div> </div>
