<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was another clan of aristocracy around there—five or six families—mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses. </p><p>One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:</p><p>"Quick! Jump for the woods!"</p><p> We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.</p></div> </div>
