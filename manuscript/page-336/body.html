<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal them. </p><p> It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before.</p></div> </div>
