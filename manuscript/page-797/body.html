<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn&apos;t so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, &quot;There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you&apos;d a done it they&apos;d a learnt you there that people that acts as I&apos;d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.&quot; </p><p> It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn&apos;t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn&apos;t come. Why wouldn&apos;t they?
