<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was&#x2014;a skiff, away across the water. I couldn&apos;t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn&apos;t but one man in it. Think&apos;s I, maybe it&apos;s pap, though I warn&apos;t expecting him. </p><p> He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it was pap, sure enough&#x2014;and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars. </p></div> </div>
