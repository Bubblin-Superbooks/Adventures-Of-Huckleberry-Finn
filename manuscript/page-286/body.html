Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the menâ€”I reckon I hadn't had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix. </p><p>"The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.</p></div> </div>
