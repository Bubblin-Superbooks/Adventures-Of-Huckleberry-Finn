He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn&apos;t we see them, then? He said if I warn&apos;t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. </p><p> He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. </p></div> </div>
