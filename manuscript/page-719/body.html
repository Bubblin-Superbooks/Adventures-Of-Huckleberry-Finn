<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;I wish I knowed, but I don&apos;t. I had it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I&apos;m afraid it ain&apos;t there no more. I&apos;m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I&apos;m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. </p><p>&quot;Oh, stop blaming yourself&#x2014;it&apos;s too bad to do it, and I won&apos;t allow it&#x2014;you couldn&apos;t help it; it wasn&apos;t your fault. Where did you hide it?&quot;</p></div> </div>
