But if only half a man&#x2014;like Buck Harkness, there&#x2014;shouts &apos;Lynch him! lynch him!&apos; you&apos;re afraid to back down&#x2014;afraid you&apos;ll be found out to be what you are&#x2014;cowards&#x2014;and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man&apos;s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you&apos;re going to do. </p><p> The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that&apos;s what an army is&#x2014;a mob; they don&apos;t fight with courage that&apos;s born in them, but with courage that&apos;s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness. </p></div> </div>
