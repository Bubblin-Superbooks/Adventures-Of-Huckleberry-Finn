It was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out &quot;Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!&quot; Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.</p><p>Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca&apos;m and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.</p></div> </div>
