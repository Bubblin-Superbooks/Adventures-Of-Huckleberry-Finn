But they don&apos;t always kill. Pa&apos;s got a few buckshot in him; but he don&apos;t mind it &apos;cuz he don&apos;t weigh much, anyway. Bob&apos;s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom&apos;s been hurt once or twice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?&quot;</p></div> </div>
