Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:</p><p>"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout him?"</p><p>"Well, hain't he got a father?" says Tom Sawyer.</p><p>"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more."</p><p> They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others.
