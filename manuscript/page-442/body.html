<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Dern your skin, ain&apos;t the company good enough for you?&quot; says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.</p><p> &quot;Yes, it is good enough for me; it&apos;s as good as I deserve; for who fetched me so low when I was so high? I did myself. I don&apos;t blame you, gentlemen&#x2014;far from it; I don&apos;t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know&#x2014;there&apos;s a grave somewhere for me. </p><p> The world may go on just as it&apos;s always done, and take everything from me&#x2014;loved ones, property, everything; but it can&apos;t take that. Some day I&apos;ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.&quot; He went on a-wiping. </p></div> </div>
