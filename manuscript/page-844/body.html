<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. <p>"Jim ain't got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan."</p><p>"That ain't nothing; we can get him some."</p><p>"Can't nobody read his plates."</p><p>"That ain't got anything to do with it, Huck Finn. All he's got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don't have to be able to read it.
