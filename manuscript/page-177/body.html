<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let&apos;s look around.&quot;</p><p>I didn&apos;t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.</p><p> I didn&apos;t sleep much. I couldn&apos;t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn&apos;t do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can&apos;t live this way; I&apos;m a-going to find out who it is that&apos;s here on the island with me; I&apos;ll find it out or bust. </p></div> </div>
