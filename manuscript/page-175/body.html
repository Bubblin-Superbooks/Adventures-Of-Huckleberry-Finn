<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn&apos;t see nothing, I didn&apos;t hear nothing&#x2014;I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn&apos;t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. </p><p> By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank&#x2014;about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people&apos;s voices. </p></div> </div>
