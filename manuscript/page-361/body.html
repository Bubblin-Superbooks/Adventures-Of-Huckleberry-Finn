I only want to go along by, but the dogs won't let me."</p><p>"What are you prowling around here this time of night for—hey?"</p><p>"I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat."</p><p>"Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you say your name was?"</p><p>"George Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy."</p><p>"Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid—nobody'll hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?"</p></div> </div>
