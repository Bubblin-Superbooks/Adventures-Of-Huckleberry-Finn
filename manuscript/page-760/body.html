<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. <p> We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out.</p></div> </div>
