If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn&apos;t give him up, I&apos;d hang him.&quot; And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says:</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it&apos;s us; we&apos;re going to set you free.&quot;</p></div> </div>
