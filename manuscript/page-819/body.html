Where'd she get aground?"</p><p> I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from down towards Orleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names of bars down that way. </p><p>"It warn't the grounding—that didn't keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head."</p></div> </div>
