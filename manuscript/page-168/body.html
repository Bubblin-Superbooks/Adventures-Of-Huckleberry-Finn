<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it. </p><p> I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I&apos;d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did. When she&apos;d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. </p></div> </div>
