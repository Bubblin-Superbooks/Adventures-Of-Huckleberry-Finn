<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. </p><p> I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outâ€”big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. </p></div> </div>
