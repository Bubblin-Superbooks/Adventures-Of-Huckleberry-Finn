<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank&#x2014;about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people&apos;s voices. </p><p>&quot;We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let&apos;s look around.&quot;</p><p>I didn&apos;t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.</p></div> </div>
