<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o&apos;clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. </p><p> I was powerful lazy and comfortable&#x2014;didn&apos;t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of &quot;boom!&quot; away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. </p></div> </div>
