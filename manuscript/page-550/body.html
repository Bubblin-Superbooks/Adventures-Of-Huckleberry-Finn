<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t&apos;other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, &quot;Boggs!&quot; and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says &quot;Bang!&quot; staggered backwards, says &quot;Bang!&quot; again, and fell down flat on his back. </p></div> </div>
