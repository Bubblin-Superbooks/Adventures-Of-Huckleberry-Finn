<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> (&quot;House to rob, you mean,&quot; says I to myself; &quot;and when you get through robbing it you&apos;ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft&#x2014;and you&apos;ll have to take it out in wondering.&quot;) And he said if he warn&apos;t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along. </p><p> So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn&apos;t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway&#x2014;and maybe a chance for the change on top of it. </p></div> </div>
