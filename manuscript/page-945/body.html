Answer, or I&apos;ll shoot!&quot;</p><p>But we didn&apos;t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there was a rush, and a <i>Bang, Bang, Bang!</i> and the bullets fairly whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:</p><p>&quot;Here they are! They&apos;ve broke for the river! After &apos;em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!&quot;</p><p> So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn&apos;t wear no boots and didn&apos;t yell. We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them. </p></div> </div>
