The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:</p><p>&quot;Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet-bags. And if he&apos;s gone over to t&apos;other side, go over there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.&quot;</p><p> I see what he was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it&#x2014;every last word of it. </p></div> </div>
