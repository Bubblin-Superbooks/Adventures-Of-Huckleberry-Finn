There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:<p>"Hello, you!"</p><p>But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:</p><p>"De man ain't asleep—he's dead. You hold still—I'll go en see."</p><p>He went, and bent down and looked, and says:</p><p>"It's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He's ben shot in de back. I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look at his face—it's too gashly."</p></div> </div>
