<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&apos;ll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I&apos;m away down the river, I&apos;ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it&apos;s hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn&apos;t let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet. </p><p> So, thinks I, I&apos;ll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke&apos;s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn&apos;t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. </p></div> </div>
