<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;It&apos;s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we&apos;ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that&apos;s out of kings.&quot;</p><p>What was the use to tell Jim these warn&apos;t real kings and dukes? It wouldn&apos;t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you couldn&apos;t tell them from the real kind.</p><p> I went to sleep, and Jim didn&apos;t call me when it was my turn. He often done that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I didn&apos;t take notice nor let on. I knowed what it was about. </p></div> </div>
