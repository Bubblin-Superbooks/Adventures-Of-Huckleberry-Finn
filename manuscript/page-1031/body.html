<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;She needn&apos;t,&quot; I says, &quot;because we was all right. We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn&apos;t find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid&apos;s at the post-office to see what he can hear, and I&apos;m a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we&apos;re going home.&quot; </p></div> </div>
