<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up&#x2014;about abreast the ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. </p><p> I was pretty hungry, but it warn&apos;t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning&#x2014;so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. </p></div> </div>
