<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting together&#x2014;that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t&apos;other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn&apos;t say nothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said &quot;Goo-goo&#x2014;goo-goo-goo&quot; all the time, like a baby that can&apos;t talk. </p></div> </div>
